Predict: 
it would output the inputted length of the square and its area. 

Modify: 
import math
radius = input("Please input a length: ")
radius = float(radius)
areaS = (radius * 2) ** 2
areaC = (math.pi * (radius ** 2))/2
area = areaS + areaC
print("The area of a normal window of side length", radius, "is:", area)
