Predict: 
it would output the inputted length of the square and its area. 

Modify: 
import math
length = input("Please input a length: ")
length = float(length)
areaS = math.pow(length, 2)
areaC = (math.pi * (length / 2)/2)
area = areaS + areaC
print("The area of a normal window of side length", length, "is:", area)
