inches = 10 ** 12
(foot, inches) = divmod(inches, 12)
(yard, foot) = divmod(foot, 3)
(mile, yard) = divmod(yard, 1760)
(moon, mile) = divmod(mile, 238855)

print("One trillion inches is the same as going to the moon and back")
print(moon, "times, plus an extra", mile, "miles", yard,
      "yards", foot, "feet and", inches, "inches")

-> One trillion inches is the same as going to the moon and back
66 times, plus an extra 18398 miles 497 yards 2 feet and 4 inches
